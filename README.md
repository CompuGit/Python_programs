# Python Programs
    
    Hello Folks..! 
    
    You can find the list of program questions and their solutions here, which are level wise categorized as per the lecutres in the contents. I request you don not directly ahead for program solution. 

    Please try yourself first and improve you coding skills. if not satisfied with your code then only refer to the soltion.

    I hope everyone a good luck and wish you a happy coding.... :)

After lecture 8
# Stage 6 Programs
    1.	WAP to find min and max number in an array and print in (min, max) tuple format.
        #Input : [2,4,5,1,3]
        #ouput : (1,5)

    2.	WAP to find given anagram available in the other string, if yes print their indices.
        #Input : 'baccbbbdabcdbca' 'abc'
        #Output : [0,8,12]  

    3.	WAP to play the cards game where cards are all arranged front and back

        at the last if the is 1 we win else we loose


After lecture 9
# Stage 7 Programs
    1.	WAP to count the repeated words in a string

        #Output : abc=2 bca=2 cba=1 cab=1 acb=2

    2.	create a phonebook with the following names and their numbers respectively. print now the phonebook.
        #Andrew Parson = 8806336
        #Emily Everett = 6784346
        #Peter Power = 7658344
        #Lewis Lame = 1122345

        do the necessary modifications to the phonebook as follows
         1. Andrew's number is wrongs update it to 8806334 and show phone book
         2. add Gingerbread John to phonebook yet he doesn’t have any phone number so keep it None and show
         3. show all the persons
         4. show all the phone numbers
         5. now create addressbook for the users from phonebook

        #Output : 120

    2.	WAP to limit the keystrokes for a string using functions the input considered to the list of character and limt separated by comma and a given string text
        #Input : lst = ['e,3','t,5','a,1','s,1']; text = 'statement is a statement'
        #Output : 'statement i  ttemn'

    3.	write a function check if given string is balanced with brackets or not
        #Input : '( ( ) [ ( ) ] { ( ) } )' #Output : True
        #Input : '( ( ) { [ } )' #Output : False


# Test - 2


## Start Oops with Py Lectures along with the below mini-projects


# Mini projects at the end of all core concepts
    There are given google-python-exercises and a mini game rock papers scissors
    Visit those and write the code for them as desired accoring the their outputs.

    Please dont look into solution unless you tried first.

    Good luck...! :)
